\title{Analyze file exports in an R script}
\usage{
analyze_exports(script_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{script_path}{Character. Full path to the R script to analyze}
}
\value{
Character vector of unique file paths that are exported by the script.
  Returns empty character(0) if no exports found or file doesn't exist.
}
\description{
Main function to detect all file export operations in an R script. Automatically
handles .R, .Rmd, and .qmd files. Detects 10+ export functions including
write.csv(), saveRDS(), ggsave(), fwrite(), and more.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
  \item Reads the script file
  \item Extracts R code from Rmd/qmd files if needed
  \item Detects export function calls using pattern matching
  \item Resolves here::here() paths
  \item Filters out invalid or malformed paths
  \item Returns unique file paths
}

Supported export functions include base R (write.csv, saveRDS, save),
readr (write_csv, write_tsv), ggplot2 (ggsave), data.table (fwrite),
writexl (write_xlsx), and more.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Analyze exports for a single script
exports <- analyze_exports("R/03_process_data.R")
print(exports)

# Check if specific file is exported
if ("results/processed_data.RDS" \%in\% exports) {
  cat("Script exports processed_data.RDS\n")
}
}
